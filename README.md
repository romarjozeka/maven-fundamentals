# maven-fundamentals

**Note**: The project is not yet finished, unit tests need to be made and some other fixes.

The goal of this project is to learn the fundamentals of Maven (Maven 3.6.3 at the time of writing).

This is part of me learning modern Java development.

The "learning-git" repository was also another part of my path.

**The basic maven example will be done from scratch for the sake of learning.**

**The multi module will be created from Maven integrated in Intellij**

The project will be divided into the following sections.

1)A basic Maven example \
2)A multi module example with more than one pom files

Environment: \
JDK 11 \
Maven 3.6.3 \
IntelliJ IDEA \
GitKraken 7.0.0

# maven-fundamentals

The goal of this project is to learn the fundamentals of Maven (Maven 3.6.3 at the time of writing).

This is part of me learning modern Java development.

The "learning-git" repository was also another part of my path.

**I know that IDEs have Maven integrated to quickly bootstrap a Maven app or use a template toolkit like Maven Archetype, but i will do each step from scratch for the sake of learning.**

The project will be divided into the following sections.

1)A basic Maven example

2)A multi module example with more than one pom files.
